Notes on Django tutorial:

1. I dont understand how a database works

  Databases are built upon tables: columns represent the fields(of data) and the rows represent the each record of data, which has been saved on the database.

  WHAT IS A PRIMARY KEY?
  A PRIMARY KEY is a data field that is specific to that record, and hence uniquely identifies each table record.
  Each database record has one primary key.
  You can think of them as an address.  If the rows in a table were mailboxes, then the primary key would be the listing of street addresses.

  WHAT IS A FOREIGN KEY?
  A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together: A FOREIGN KEY is a field / collection of fields in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

  For example:
  author = models.ForeignKey('Author', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True) refers to the primary key of the model/class Author(not defined yet, hence the string)

  WHAT IS A VIEW FUNCTION?
  A view is a function that processes an HTTP request, fetches the required data from the database,
  renders the data in an HTML page using an HTML template, and then returns the generated HTML in an HTTP response to display the page to the user.
  The index view follows this model â€” it fetches information about the number of Book, BookInstance,
  available BookInstance and Author records that we have in the database, and passes that information to a template for display.



QUESTIONS:

  How do each of the models interact with eachother?

  What do ManyToManyFields and ManToOneFiels(ForeignKey) do and how does it know in a table which primary key to take?

  How does the method get_absolute_url work?

  What is the difference between verbose-name and __str__()?

  Do sites like instagram still have a django admin site?
